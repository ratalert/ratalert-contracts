RatAlert Game
==============

**The NFT game that lets you #train2earn higher rewards from your characters!**
**Powered by the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) l2 blockchain.**

This repository contains the Solidity smart [contracts](./contracts/) of the game.

## Audit

All contracts have been audited by [CertiK](https://www.certik.com/projects/rat-alert), the final report has been revisioned on May 10, 2022. 

## Community & DAO

### DAO Gnosis Safe

All funds are managed by (and can only be withdrawn to) the RatAlert [DAO Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/matic:0xbEf526C8325C47817ceb435011bf1E6bc9ec691d/home), a 4 of 6 multisig wallet owned by 3 co-founders & 3 community members.

2. **juggernod#0921** (co-founder)
3. **cap#5523** (co-founder)

5. **Cerfidus(ðŸ§½,ðŸ”±)#2350** (community member)
6. **KryptoDreamz#0921** (community member) 

### Contract Ownership & Timelock

All contracts are owned by an OpenZeppelin [TimelockController](https://github.com/ratalert/ratalert-dao/blob/master/contracts/TimelockController.sol), deployed at [0x32dd....0924](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x32dd207f1f16dd4ceea94833ab9fb5dd96bc0924#code).
Only the RatAlert [DAO Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/matic:0xbEf526C8325C47817ceb435011bf1E6bc9ec691d/home) is allowed to schedule and execute changes after a 48h delay.

### Governance

We are currently evaluating the RatAlert governance tool and will be launching it very soon...


## Forks

We encourage projects to fork our contracts. However, we ask that the **RatAlert DAO** receives a **10% stake** in your project.


## Development

### Initial Setup

- Make sure you have Truffle installed globally: `npm install -g truffle`.
- Optional: Create a `.env` file in the **project root** directory, run `npx mnemonics` and add the seed phrase in a new line:

      MNEMONIC="your twelve word seed phrase"
      TIMELOCK_MIN_DELAY="0" # Disable timelock in tests

- Run `npm install`


### Repository Structure

- [bin/](./bin/) contains a Truffle CLI to interact with contracts
- [contracts/](./contracts/) contains all Solidity smart contract game logic
- [images/](./images/) contains all Characters & Kitchen PNGs that are being composed by the contracts
- [test/](./test/) contains the Mocha test suite
- [config.js](./config.js) contains the contract configuration


### Run The Tests

1. Run a local development blockchain in a separate tab: `truffle develop`
2. Run the test suite: `truffle test`


### Local Development

1. Run a local development blockchain in a separate tab: `truffle develop`
2. Optional: Compile the contracts `truffle compile`
3. Deploy the contracts locally: `truffle migrate`
4. Interact with them using the console: `truffle console`

#### Local VRF Coordinator

Both [Mint](./contracts/Mint.sol) & [Claim](./contracts/Claim.sol) use ChainLink VRF to fulfill requests.
In order to simulate VRF locally, we use a truffle external script that listens for `RandomNumberRequested`
events and triggers the respective rawFulfillRandomness() callback function.

By default, the VRF coordinator is not enabled. To enable, add the following line to your .env file:

    LOCAL_VRF="true"

Then run a deployment using `truffle migrate` and start the VRF coordinator using `truffle exec bin/vrf.js`.


### Configuration

Each environment uses its own .env file:

- `.env` for development & tests
- `.env.test` for private integration testing
- `.env.beta` for public beta testing
- `.env.main` for the public live game

All contract configuration is in [config.js](./config.js) but references the env variables from the respective .env file. This is where you make overrides.


### Deployment

1. Choose an environment to deploy
2. Optional: Create new mnemonics `npx mnemonics` and add them to the respective .env file
3. Get the first account address. In the console, run `web3.eth.getAccounts()` and copy the first address
4. Fund this address with 0.5 MATIC using the [faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) in Mumbai testnet
5. Deploy the contracts: `truffle migrate --network <network>`
6. Get the contract addresses: `truffle network`
7. Fund the Claim & Mint contracts with LINK using the [faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/mumbai) in Mumbai testnet


## RatAlert DAO

All contracts that carry game mechanics are [upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable).
The idea behind this is to enable the RatAlert DAO to agree upon and change parameters of the game if required.
